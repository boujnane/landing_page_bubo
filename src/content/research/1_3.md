## Research Initiative: Phase 3

![AI Research Initiative Phase 3](../../assets/releases/starlog-placeholder-18.jpg)

In Phase 3 of the initiative, we explore the integration of AI with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract actionable insights from documents, automating knowledge discovery.

### Research Goals

- **Text Analysis**: Using AI to analyze large volumes of text for key insights.
- **Entity Recognition**: Developing NLP algorithms to automatically identify key entities within documents.

### Challenges

- **Data Complexity**: Managing complex data formats from different sources.
- **Model Transparency**: Improving the interpretability of AI models in text analysis.
