### Why this CIR Accreditation

During this phase, Bubo successfully obtained CIR accreditation (Research Tax Credit), a significant milestone that underscores our commitment to high-level R&D.

The CIR is a French program that encourages investment in R&D by enabling companies to benefit from a tax credit to fund innovative research projects. However, only companies and service providers with accreditation issued by the Ministry of Research can allow their clients to claim this tax credit for subcontracted R&D expenses.

#### <u>Obtaining CIR accreditation for Bubo means two key things:</u>

  - **Recognition of Research Expertise**: Official certification by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research, affirming Bubo's ability to execute advanced R&D projects.
  - **Benefits for Clients**: By collaborating with us on their R&D projects, our clients can now benefit from a tax credit on the expenses incurred, making their investments more affordable and directly impacting their capacity to innovate.


### What This Means for Bubo and Our Partners

For Bubo, this accreditation commits us to strengthening and deepening our research expertise, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence applied to high-value business use cases. This program allows us to work more closely with our partners in France while contributing to the R&D ecosystem with practical, sustainable solutions aligned with everyday human needs.

By collaborating with us, our clients can trust they are investing in a solution that is not only powerful but also supported by advantageous fiscal mechanisms such as the CIR, a valuable tool for technological innovation in France.

### The Future of Bubo with the CIR Accreditation

This accreditation opens up exciting prospects and reinforces our mission to provide digital solutions that bring real value to our users. It is a testament to our commitment to maintaining high-quality standards and rigor in R&D while continuing to develop solutions accessible to everyone.

We look forward to continuing this journey, transforming the challenges of your documents and much more through artificial intelligence, and making innovation accessible to all, everywhere.
