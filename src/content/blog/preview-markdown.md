### *Revolutionizing Legal Practice: How Bubo enhanced a lawyers firm efficiency with a fine-tuned legal AI assistant*

---

#### 1. *Business context for the client*

Based in Paris, this lawyers firm stands out as a forward-thinking company with a commitment to delivering multidisciplinary and strategically tailored legal solutions for diverse client needs. Aiming to streamline internal operations and enhance client services, this law firm partnered with Bubo to implement a fine-tuned, "GPT-like" AI model specifically designed for legal applications. This strategic transformation aimed to harness AI’s potential to automate routine legal tasks, boost efficiency, and offer clients an enhanced, responsive experience—all in a user-friendly platform.

### *2. The AI / data challenges faced*

The client faced several challenges as it sought to modernize its approach to handling client communications and documentation. As the firm continued to expand its client base, the growing volume of legal paperwork and client interactions created significant operational burdens. Manually summarizing client conversations, drafting documents, analyzing legal positions, and managing case files demanded a substantial time investment from legal staff, reducing their capacity to focus on high-value strategic work.

Technical limitations also hindered efficiency; traditional tools lacked the adaptability and specificity needed to support complex, nuanced legal tasks effectively. The firm needed a solution that could not only understand legal language but also seamlessly integrate with their workflow, allowing attorneys to interact intuitively with AI to quickly produce summaries, agreements, and communications aligned with client needs.

### *3. How Bubo helped*

To meet these challenges, Bubo designed a tailored AI solution with a fine-tuned language model specifically crafted for legal use. Our approach included several key steps:

- *Custom AI model trainings*: Leveraging open legal data, Bubo fine-tuned a "GPT-like" model to specialize in understanding and processing legal terminology and document structures. This model was trained to recognize and analyze legal language accurately, enabling the client to automate tasks such as drafting fee agreements, summarizing case discussions, and generating structured case files.

- *User interface*: We developed an intuitive chatbot-style interface that allowed legal professionals to interact directly with the AI model and upload document directly. This interface enabled staff to easily request and receive AI-generated summaries, document drafts, and legal analyses, effectively creating a virtual assistant that could support day-to-day tasks with minimal friction.

- *Efficiency*: By automating routine processes, Bubo’s solution transformed the firm ability to handle high document volumes with consistent quality. Our model could draft, analyze, and organize information with accuracy, freeing up legal professionals to focus more on strategic work and client relations.

Through this structured approach, Bubo delivered a solution uniquely adapted to the lawyers firm needs, enhancing their workflow and supporting their commitment to client-centered legal service.

### *4. Results*

Following the AI implementation by Bubo, the client achieved operational improvements:

- Reduced time spent on document drafting and summarizing by over ~30%, allowing lawyers to reallocate time toward strategic legal tasks.
- Automated case file creation, fee agreement drafting, and email preparation improved turnaround times, positively impacting client satisfaction.
- AI-driven summaries and structured case files enhanced organization, providing attorneys with quick access to essential client information.

> Bubo has been instrumental in transforming our practice through innovative AI solutions. Since ChatGPT, everyone wants to understand how to work with GenAI, how to use it on a day-to-day basis, but to do concrete and useful experiments really is another level. Bubo expertise in tailoring the model for legal applications has given us an edge in efficiency, allowing our team to dedicate more time to client strategy. The seamless integration has exceeded our expectations, and we look forward to furthering this partnership as we continue to grow.
