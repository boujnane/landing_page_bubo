# LLM fundamentals: understanding tokens, the building blocks of artificial intelligence

Have you ever been fascinated by the ability of artificial intelligences like ChatGPT to understand your questions and answer them in a relevant way? Behind this apparent magic lies a fundamental mechanism: **token processing**. But what exactly is a token, and why is it so crucial to the functioning of advanced language models? Let's delve into this essential element that shapes our daily interaction with AI.

## What is a token in a language model? ?

A token is the smallest unit of text that a language model (LLM) can process. Contrary to what one might intuitively think, a token does not necessarily correspond to a whole word or syllable. It can be a word, a part of a word, a special character or even a space.

To better understand this, imagine you're cutting up a text into small pieces to run through a machine. These pieces need to be small enough to be processed efficiently, but significant enough to retain meaning. This is exactly what LLMs do with tokens.

Let's take a concrete example: the sentence “I love artificial intelligence” could be divided into tokens like this: [“J‘”, “aime”, “l’”, “intelli”, “gence”, “artificielle”]. Notice how some tokens include spaces, while others represent word fragments or punctuation marks.

## How tokenization works ?

Tokenization is the process that transforms raw text into a sequence of tokens. This step is crucial, as it is the first transformation a text undergoes before being processed by an LLM.

Tokenization algorithms generally follow these principles :

For Western languages, tokens are often sub-words, making it possible to efficiently manage rare or unknown words by breaking them down into more familiar parts. For example, the word “anti-deconstitutionally” could be split into several tokens such as [“anti”, “dé”, “constitution”, “nelle”, “ment”].

For languages like Chinese or Japanese, which don't use spaces between words, tokenization relies on other methods to identify significant units.

Models like GPT use sophisticated tokenizers that have been trained on huge corpora of text to determine the most efficient divisions. These tokenizers seek to optimize language representation by balancing the size of the vocabulary (total number of possible tokens) and the average length of the sequences produced.

## Why tokens are so important ?

Tokens play a fundamental role in LLMs for several reasons :

### 1. They determine processing capacity

Each model has a limit on the number of tokens it can handle simultaneously. For example, GPT-3.5 can handle around 4,096 tokens at a time, while GPT-4 can handle up to 8,192 or more, depending on the version. This limit defines the model's “context window”, i.e. the amount of information it can consider to generate a response.

When you interact with an LLM, every message you send and every reply you receive consumes tokens. If your conversation becomes too long, the model will start to “forget” the first exchanges as they fall outside its context window.

### 2. They influence operating costs

Most LLM APIs charge according to the number of tokens processed. The longer your request, the more it costs. That's why developers often seek to optimize their prompts to get the best results with the fewest tokens.

### 3. They affect the quality of responses

The way in which a text is tokenized can influence the understanding of the model. Some technical words, proper nouns or specialized terms may be poorly tokenized, which can affect the quality of responses. This is particularly true for languages less represented in the training data.

## Language-specific tokenization features

Tokenization does not work identically in all languages. Here are a few notable differences:

In English, a token represents on average around 4 characters or 3/4 of a word.

In French, tokens are generally longer due to the structure of the language and its grammatical peculiarities.

In Asian languages such as Japanese or Chinese, a single character can represent an entire concept, which makes tokenization very different.

These differences explain why translating a text can significantly change its token count. For example, a text with 100 tokens in English might require 130 or more tokens when translated into French.

## How to optimize the use of tokens ?

To make the most of LLMs while keeping costs and limitations under control, here are some practical tips:

1. **Be concise in your requests**: Eliminate non-essential information and get straight to the point.

2. **Use structured formats**: Clear, well-organized instructions often produce better answers with fewer tokens.

3. **Understand the limits of your model**: Knowing how many tokens your model can handle will help you structure your interactions more efficiently.

4. **Test different formulations**: Sometimes, rephrasing a question can significantly reduce the number of tokens needed, while improving the quality of the answer.

## Tokens and the future of LLMs

As language models evolve, their ability to handle longer contexts increases. The latest versions of models such as Claude or GPT-4 can now handle tens or even hundreds of thousands of tokens, enabling analysis of entire documents or much longer conversations.

This opens up new possibilities, such as the analysis of complex legal contracts, the generation of detailed summaries of entire books, or AI assistants capable of maintaining conversational memory over long periods.

However, even with these advances, understanding and optimizing the use of tokens remains essential for anyone wishing to exploit the full potential of LLMs.

## Conclusion: tokens are more than just a technicality

Tokens are much more than just a technical detail in the operation of LLMs. They represent the way these systems perceive and process human language. By understanding how tokenization works, you can not only use these tools more effectively, but also better grasp their strengths and limitations.

Whether you're an occasional ChatGPT user or a developer integrating LLMs into your applications, this knowledge will help you achieve better results and anticipate future developments in this fascinating technology.

The next time you interact with an LLM, remember that behind every word of their response lies the fundamental process of tokenization, the bridge between our human language and artificial intelligence.
