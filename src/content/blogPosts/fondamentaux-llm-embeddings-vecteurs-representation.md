# Embeddings: The invisible magic behind LLMs

Have you ever been impressed by a chatbot's ability to understand your questions, even when phrased differently? Or perhaps you've wondered how Google manages to find relevant results, even when you don't use exactly the same words as in the web pages? Behind these feats lies a fascinating technology: embeddings, or representation vectors.

## What exactly is embedding? ?

Imagine you had to explain to a computer what an “apple” was. How would you go about it? Computers don't naturally understand words the way we do. **For them, everything has to be translated into numbers**.

An embedding is just that: a translation of words, phrases or documents into a series of numbers (vectors) that capture their meaning. It's as if each word or concept were given its own coordinates in a multi-dimensional mathematical space.

“Embeddings are the semantic backbone of LLMs, the gateway through which plain text is transformed into number vectors understandable by the model,” explains an expert from Hugging Face. This transformation is fundamental to enabling machines to understand the nuances of human language.

## Why embeddings are so important ?

To understand the importance of embeddings, let's take a simple analogy. Imagine a library where, instead of arranging books in alphabetical order, you place them by similarity of content. Detective novels would be close together, as would cookery books or scientific works.

This is exactly what embeddings do in vector space: they position similar words or concepts close together. So “cat” and “feline” will be close together, while “cat” and “car” will be far apart.

This spatial organization enables artificial intelligence models to :

- Understand semantic relationships between words
- Understand the nuances and context of a sentence
- Make relevant associations between different concepts
- Generate coherent, contextual responses

## How embeddings work ?

When you enter a phrase into a language model like ChatGPT, each word is first transformed into an embedding vector. This is not a simple word-to-number substitution, but rather a complex representation that captures the meaning of the word in different contexts.

These vectors usually have hundreds or thousands of dimensions. Each dimension can be seen as a particular characteristic of the word: its level of formality, its lexical field, its emotional connotation, etc.

For example, the word “bank” could have high values in dimensions related to finance, institutions and services, but low values in dimensions related to nature or cooking.

What's fascinating is that these representations are not created manually by humans. They emerge naturally when a model is trained on huge quantities of text. The model gradually learns which words appear in similar contexts and adjusts their vectors accordingly.

## The evolution of embeddings: from simple to sophisticated

Embedding techniques have evolved considerably over time :

### The beginnings: One-Hot Encoding

Originally, words were represented by “one-hot” vectors: a vector filled with zeros, with a single “1” at the position corresponding to the word in the vocabulary. Simple but inefficient, this method didn't capture any relationships between words.

### The Word2Vec revolution

In 2013, Google introduced Word2Vec, a revolutionary technique that created embeddings that truly captured the semantic relationships between words. Suddenly, models could understand that “king” is to “man” what “queen” is to “woman”.

### Les embeddings contextuels

Modern techniques such as BERT and GPT have introduced contextual embeddings. Unlike previous models where a word always had the same vector, these models generate different embeddings depending on the context. For example, “avocado” will have a different embedding in “I ate an avocado” and “I consulted a lawyer”.

## LLM embeddings: the heart of the system

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 or Claude are fundamentally based on embeddings. They are the first step in the processing of any textual information.

“When you query an LLM to help debug your code, your words and tokens are transformed into a high-dimensional vector space where semantic relationships become mathematical relationships,” explains one AI researcher.
Cette transformation permet aux LLM de :

1. **Understand your query** by locating it in the vector space of concepts they know.
2. **Identify relevant information** by searching for similar vectors in their knowledge base.
3. **Generate coherent answers** by producing sequences of tokens with logical embeddings.

## Practical applications of embeddings

Embeddings are not just a theoretical concept. They are at the heart of many of the applications we use every day :

### Semantic search

When you perform a search on Google or in a modern database, embeddings enable you to find relevant results even if you don't use exactly the same words as in the documents you're looking for.

### Personalized recommendations

The recommendation systems of Netflix, Spotify or Amazon use embeddings to represent your preferences and suggest content similar to what you already enjoy.

### Feeling analysis

By transforming texts into embeddings, companies can automatically analyze the tone and sentiment expressed in customer reviews or mentions on social networks.

### Automatic translation

Modern translation systems use embeddings to capture the meaning of sentences in a source language before translating them into a target language.

## Beyond text: embeddings for everything

Although we have mainly been talking about text embeddings, this technique extends to other types of data :

### Image embeddings

Neural networks can transform images into embedding vectors, making it possible to search for similar images or understand their content.

### Embeddings audio

Music, speech and other sound signals can also be converted into embeddings, facilitating speech recognition or searches for similar tracks.

### Embeddings of graphs

Social networks or other relational structures can be represented by graph embeddings, making it possible to analyze communities or predict new connections.

## The challenges and limits of embeddings

Despite their power, embeddings have certain limitations :

### Built-in biases

Embeddings are created from existing texts, which often contain societal biases. These biases are then encoded in the vectors, potentially leading to problematic results.

### Loss of cultural nuances

Cultural subtleties, humor or local references can be poorly represented in vector spaces, especially when training data is limited to certain cultures or languages.

### Computational cost

Generating and manipulating high-quality embeddings requires significant computing resources, which may limit their use in certain contexts.

## The future of embeddings

The evolution of embeddings continues apace. Current research is exploring several promising avenues :

### Multimodal embeddings

These techniques aim to create unified representations for different types of data (text, image, sound), enabling a more holistic understanding of content.

### Custom Embeddings

Embeddings adapted to specific domains (medical, legal, technical) enhance model performance in these particular contexts.

### More efficient embeddings

Research is underway to reduce the size of embedding vectors while preserving their semantic richness, making them more accessible.

## Conclusion

Embeddings are truly the invisible magic that enables AI models to understand our language. By transforming words into mathematical vectors, they create a bridge between our human conceptual world and the digital universe of machines.

As this technology continues to evolve, we can expect increasingly natural and nuanced interactions with our AI assistants. Embeddings, though hidden behind the user interface, are the foundation on which all machine understanding of language rests.

The next time you're impressed by the relevance of a chatbot response or the accuracy of a search, remember that at the heart of this feat are these fascinating vectors of representation, silently translating our language into a format that machines can understand and manipulate.
